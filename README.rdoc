== INSTALL

* gem install http-parser

== DESCRIPTION

This is a ruby wrapper around the
{http-parser}[http://github.com/ry/http-parser/tree/master] library.  The
upstream http-parser library is, in itself, an evolution of Zed Shaw's
http11_parser that is part {mongrel}[http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/]

So this library has come full circle back to ruby again.
